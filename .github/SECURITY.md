Once we receive your report, we will review it and follow up as soon as possible. We will work with you to resolve the issue before making any public announcements.

## Security Updates

We release security patches as needed. We encourage all users to stay up-to-date with the latest releases to mitigate vulnerabilities. The following guidelines apply to security updates:

- **Major vulnerabilities** will be patched and a security release will be made.
- **Minor issues** will be patched in upcoming regular releases.

## General Security Best Practices

- **Do not expose sensitive information** such as API keys or passwords in the codebase or commits.
- Regularly update dependencies to ensure security patches are applied to third-party libraries.
- Follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, to minimize vulnerabilities.
